time complexity of Queue DS
uses FIFO => first in first out
best way to think is like an entrance to roller coaster.

lookup			O(n)	you don't usually traverse values using queue. because it is heavy operation
enqueue			O(1)	add value to the top of queue
peek			O(1)  	view the first/front value
dequeue			O(1)  	remove value from the front of queue.


where is it used for?
	-reservation for a restaurant table
	-line for a roller coaster
	-uber and lyft ride request
	-waiting line for theater
	-printer queue

**** 	we can implement queues using arrays and linked lists
****	But using an array to implement queue is very inefficient
**** 	Java has queue interface
