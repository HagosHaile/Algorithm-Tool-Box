time complexity of stack DS
uses FILO => first in last out
lookup		O(n)	you don't usually traverse values using stack. because it is heavy operation
pop			O(1)	remove value from the top of stack
peek		O(1)  	view the last value
push		O(1)  	add value to the end of stack


where is it used?
	-language engines
	-stack overflow
	-last item accessed
	-most programming languages are modeled with the stack architecture in mind
	-when functions(methods) are called they follow the stack principle
	-browser history back and forth
	-when writing a text(i.e undo to go back and redo to go forward)
	
*** arrays help for cash locality since elements are stored in consecuative memory location
*** Java has built in stack
stacks can be implemented using array and linked list. both work fairly well. depends on the scenario.
