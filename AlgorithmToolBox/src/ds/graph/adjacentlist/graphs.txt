-Are one of the most useful and most used Data structures in computer science 
 when it comes to modeling in real relationships.
 
graphs have
	Nodes or vertex
	edges
	
can be used to represent 
	networks
	family relationships
	friendships
	web
	Facebook uses it for their social network
	amazon uses it for their recommendations engines
	google uses it for google map to determine the shortest path
	
	
there are many types of graphs. But what are the main characteristics of graphs
	directed  	=> like one way street
	undirected 	=> like highway between two cities
	
Facebook for example uses undirected graph i.e when I am connected to a friend 
he is automatically  connected to me too.

twitter is directed: I just follow a friend. doesnt mean he is following through the same request.

weighted Vs unweighted graphs
*** values can be assigned to various aspects of a graph

weighted 													unweighted 
														used by google map to calculate shortest path
														
													
cyclic vs Acyclic graphs

cyclic														Acyclic graphs
														are common in weighted graphs like google map
														because there is a way to come back

	
DAG is directed acyclic graph used in block chain
Graphs are built on top of other data structures.


ways to implement graphs
	Edge list
	Adjacent list
	Adjacent matrix
	
pros and cons of graph
	pros														cons
relationships												hard to scale
