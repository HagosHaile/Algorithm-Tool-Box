Rules of BST
	values at the right child of a node are greater than the left
	a node can only have up to two children

time complexity of BST @ average
	lookup	O(logN)
	insert	O(logN)
	delete	O(logN)
	
But when it is unbalanced or worst case scenario
	lookup	O(N)
	insert	O(N)
	delete	O(N)
	
But how do we balance BST?
	AVL tree
	Red black tree
	
pros and cons of BST
		pros								cons
	better than O(N)						No O(1) operations
	ordered
	flexible size

** BST are not the fastest for anything

Traversing
	in-order 	left	root 	right
	pre-order	root	left 	right
	post-order	left 	right 	root
