left and right can be any value except that it should be less than the root


time complexity of Binary heap @ average
	lookup	O(N)
	insert	O(logN)
	delete	O(logN)
	
	
Example
	
						101
				72				33
			2		45		5		1

			
binary heap are very good in comparative operations
heaps are usually used in data storage
they preserve the order of insertion
searching is slower than binary search tree


	better than O(N)					slower lookup
	flexible size
	priority
	fast insertion
	
find min and find max is O(1)
