Dynamic programming can be defined as (Divide and Conquer) + Memoization.

Steps to implement dynamic programming
	1. Can the problem be divided into subProblems
	2. Can it be solved with recursion
	3. Are there repetitive subproblems
	4. MEMOIZE subproblems
	
	
	
Fibonacci MEMOIZATION facts

recursive
	-the time taken by recursive Fibonacci is O(2^n) or exponential
	-space complexity of recursive is O(N).

iterative	
	-iterative time complexity is O(n)
	-space complexity of iteration is O(1).

recursive using MEMOIZATION
	-the time taken by recursive Fibonacci is O(N) or exponential
	-space complexity of recursive is O(N).
